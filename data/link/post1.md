Ok, Good morning. I'm off on an adventure to rescue the Princess. I'll bring my sword because, it's dangerous to go into caves alone, and my sword counts as people.

Someone gave me this map. I should keep it on me, like in the upper left-hand corner. Hyrule looks gigantic. I wonder how many rupees I can make.
